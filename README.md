My applications for Swift Student Challenge 2023 and 2025.

My 2023 application "The Transformation" is a game where the goal is to upgrade the electricity grid for a city and make it more sustainable in the process by choosing renewable energies.

My 2025 application "Decaffeinato" is an app that tracks caffeine intake, providing a dataset of Starbucks drinks. To learn more about effects of caffeine there is a quiz section.
